# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the stock screening application including chart generation problems, performance issues with bulk data loading, limited search capabilities, and UI inconsistencies. The goal is to create a robust, performant stock analysis platform with real-time data visualization and comprehensive search functionality across Indian stock markets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Chart Generation Issue

**User Story:** As a user viewing a specific stock's detail page, I want to see accurate historical price charts with real market data, so that I can make informed investment decisions based on actual price movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the chart loads THEN the system SHALL fetch actual OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from a reliable market data source
3. WHEN historical data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message instead of synthetic data
4. WHEN the user selects different time ranges (1D, 1W, 1M, etc.) THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the corresponding historical data
5. IF the API fails THEN the system SHALL show a clear error state with retry options

### Requirement 2: Implement Efficient Stock Loading and Pagination

**User Story:** As a user browsing stocks on the dashboard, I want the page to load quickly with relevant stocks, so that I can efficiently discover investment opportunities without waiting for unnecessary data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display only a limited set of stocks (20-50) initially
2. WHEN a user scrolls to the bottom THEN the system SHALL load additional stocks using infinite scroll or pagination
3. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL fetch only filtered results from the server
4. WHEN the user searches THEN the system SHALL perform server-side search to avoid loading unnecessary data
5. IF no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results" message

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Stock Search Across BSE and NSE

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to search for any stock listed on BSE or NSE by company name or symbol, so that I can find and analyze any Indian stock regardless of which exchange it's listed on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL search across both BSE and NSE exchanges
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which exchange each stock is listed on
3. WHEN a user searches by partial company name THEN the system SHALL return relevant matches with fuzzy search capabilities
4. WHEN a user searches by stock symbol THEN the system SHALL find exact and partial symbol matches
5. WHEN search results include multiple exchanges for the same company THEN the system SHALL display both options clearly
6. IF a stock is listed on both exchanges THEN the system SHALL show both listings with appropriate exchange labels

### Requirement 4: Unified Dashboard UI Design

**User Story:** As a user navigating between the dashboard and stock detail pages, I want a consistent visual experience, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL use the same dark theme and styling as the stock detail page
2. WHEN stock cards are displayed THEN they SHALL follow the same design patterns as the detail page components
3. WHEN navigation elements are shown THEN they SHALL maintain consistent styling across all pages
4. WHEN charts are displayed on the dashboard THEN they SHALL use the same chart styling as the detail page
5. IF the user switches between pages THEN the visual transition SHALL feel seamless and consistent

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Market Data Integration

2. WHEN market is open THEN price updates SHALL refresh automatically at regular intervals
3. WHEN price changes occur THEN the system SHALL highlight price movements with appropriate color coding

5. IF real-time data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate the data delay time

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Chart Features and Technical Indicators

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want access to comprehensive charting tools and technical indicators, so that I can perform detailed technical analysis of stocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
